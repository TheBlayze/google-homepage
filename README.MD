Beginning of project:

This is my first web project.
In this project I will be trying to design the google homepage.
I somewhat do not believe I can do this but I am sligtly optimistic
But I believe it will just take a bit longer because I may have not remembered alot of the information

End Of Project:

It took a while after several redo's. It was very challenging and google was a great help. I feel good that I was able to complete this and it at least looks decent. I was not able to get the search bar how I want it because I believe I am not able to get that with CSS I may be wrong but I do not want to take the effort to find out.
